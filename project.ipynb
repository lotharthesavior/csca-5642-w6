    "# Predicting NBA Players' Career Average Points Per Game\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "This project aims to predict NBA players' career average points per game (PTS) using a deep learning regression model. We leverage player attributes such as height, weight, position, draft details, and college to build a feed-forward neural network (FNN), compare it with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and XGBoost, and evaluate their performance for applications in talent scouting. The dataset is sourced from the [NBA Players Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saunakghosh/nba-players-dataset), aggregated to compute career averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and correlations.\n",
    "- Build and compare three models: FNN, CNN, and XGBoost.\n",
    "- Evaluate models using RMSE and R² metrics.\n",
    "- Discuss implications for NBA talent scouting."

    "## Discussion and Conclusion\n",
    "The results table compares the performance of the Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and XGBoost models in predicting NBA players' career average points per game (PTS). The output metrics (FNN: RMSE = 2.604043, R² = -0.099646; CNN: RMSE = 2.582621, R² = -0.081628; XGBoost: RMSE = 2.506526, R² = -0.018829) reveal significant challenges in model performance, with all models exhibiting negative R² values, indicating they perform worse than a baseline predictor of the mean PTS. Below, we discuss the key findings, their implications, and propose directions for improvement."

    "### Key Findings\n",
    "- **Model Performance**: Contrary to expectations, none of the models achieved a positive R², with XGBoost having the lowest RMSE (2.506526) and least negative R² (-0.018829), suggesting it is the most effective among the three, albeit still inadequate. The negative R² values indicate that the models fail to capture meaningful patterns in the data, performing worse than simply predicting the average PTS (mean \\~8.45). The RMSE values (\\~2.5) imply predictions are off by approximately 2.5 points, which is substantial given the PTS range of 5–14.9 after filtering. The thinking trace suggests that XGBoost's slight edge may stem from its suitability for tabular data, but its performance is hindered by weak features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**: The features used (HEIGHT, WEIGHT, POSITION_SCORE, DRAFT_YEAR_NORM, HEIGHT_WEIGHT_RATIO, HEIGHT_POSITION) were intended to capture physical and draft-related influences on PTS. However, diagnostic analysis reveals weak correlations between these features and PTS, as shown in the correlation matrix. While POSITION_SCORE (derived from player positions) and DRAFT_YEAR_NORM were hypothesized to influence PTS (e.g., guards and recent draftees might score more), their predictive power appears limited. The thinking trace notes that features like HEIGHT and WEIGHT are highly correlated with each other but not with PTS, reducing their utility. HEIGHT_POSITION, an interaction term, also failed to provide significant signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applications**: The goal was to develop a model to aid talent scouting by identifying high-scoring players based on pre-NBA attributes. However, the current negative R² values and high RMSE render the models unsuitable for practical use, as they do not reliably predict PTS. The thinking trace suggests that a successful model could help teams make informed draft decisions, but the current results do not support such applications due to poor predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations**: Several limitations explain the poor performance:\n",
    "  - **Feature Deficiency**: The dataset lacks critical features like minutes played, shooting efficiency (e.g., field goal percentage), or college statistics, which are likely stronger predictors of PTS, as noted in the thinking trace. Research, such as [The Predictive Power of the NBA Draft Combine](https://wilson-wang.medium.com/the-predictive-power-of-the-nba-draft-combine-a-statistical-analysis-b45d15931fe5), highlights the importance of performance metrics over physical attributes.\n",
    "  - **Small Dataset**: With only 973 training samples after filtering (PTS: 2–20, HEIGHT: 72–84, WEIGHT: 180–260), the dataset is too small for deep learning models (FNN, CNN) to generalize effectively, leading to overfitting, as evidenced by high validation losses (~7.4–7.7).\n",
    "  - **Data Filtering**: Restrictive outlier removal reduced data diversity, limiting the models' ability to learn varied patterns. The PTS range (5–14.9) is narrow, with a low standard deviation (2.64), making it challenging to predict subtle differences.\n",
    "  - **CNN Suitability**: The thinking trace confirms CNNs are less suited for tabular data, contributing to their poor performance (R² = -0.081628).\n",
    "  - **Feature Selection**: Selecting only 4 features via SelectKBest may have excluded potentially useful interactions, as the thinking trace suggests weak linear correlations with PTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Future Work**: To improve model performance, several strategies are proposed:\n",
    "  - **Incorporate Additional Features**: Include DRAFT_NUMBER (imputing 100 for undrafted players), as higher draft picks are often better scorers, per [Average Statistics Behind NBA Players Drafted from 2010–2020](https://medium.com/@jpinedude63/average-statistics-behind-nba-players-drafted-from-2010-2020-17c0e4b2445c). If available, add performance metrics like college points per game or NBA minutes played.\n",
    "  - **Relax Data Filtering**: Expand ranges (e.g., PTS: 0–35, HEIGHT: 66–90, WEIGHT: 150–350) to increase sample size (~2500–3000 samples), enhancing data diversity.\n",
    "  - **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Explore polynomial or interaction terms (e.g., POSITION_SCORE * DRAFT_NUMBER) or use domain knowledge to create features like \"expected scoring role\" based on position and draft status.\n",
    "  - **Model Simplification**: Use simpler models like LinearRegression or RandomForest as baselines to test feature predictive power, as suggested in the thinking trace. For deep learning, experiment with shallow architectures or transformers if data size increases.\n",
    "  - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Further optimize XGBoost with broader grid search (e.g., more learning_rate values) and test ensemble methods to boost performance.\n",
    "  - **Data Augmentation**: If possible, source additional data (e.g., from Basketball-Reference.com) to enrich the dataset, as recommended in the thinking trace.\n"
